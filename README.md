The Library Management System is a full-stack CRUD application that allows efficient management of library books and user transactions. Built with React for the frontend and Node.js with Express for the backend, it enables users to add, update, delete, and view books, as well as borrow and return them. The system integrates with a MySQL database to store data related to books, users, and transactions. It also provides a user-friendly interface for managing books and a simple dashboard to track library statistics. The app is designed to streamline the process of book management in libraries.
